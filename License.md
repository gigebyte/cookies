# Licensing of jquery.cookies.js #

jquery.cookies.js is currently available for use in all personal or commercial projects under BSD, MIT, and GPL licenses. This means that you can choose the license that best suits your project, and use it accordingly.

## Options Explained ##

My original versions of this library (<= 1.3) were released under the BSD license.  I am maintaining that license in version 2 for anyone comfortable with it.  But given jQuery's dual MIT/GPL licensing I am also allowing use of them for anyone more comfortable.
