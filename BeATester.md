# Testing jquery.cookies.js from SVN #
I've made some enhancements in recent commits to the library that I'd like to have some help in testing.  There are two types of testing which would help:

## Does your existing code work with an updated copy of the library? ##
Already using jquery.cookies.js?  You can help me test by replacing the release version you're using on your page with the latest version of the library from trunk ( http://code.google.com/p/cookies/source/browse/ ) and see if your page still works as expected.

## Do new features and bug fixes work properly? ##
Read through the more recent commits and the issues they fixed/enhanced (which issues are linked in the commit comments). Try out new features and see if they work the way you expect them to.  The docs aren't updated with these new features yet, so read the commits, issues, and code to get a feel for things.  While you're in there, do a little code review and offer suggestions on improvements.

## Tell me ##
Regardless of the type testing or reviewing you do, please comment on this Wiki page to tell me your thoughts.

Thanks very much for your help!
